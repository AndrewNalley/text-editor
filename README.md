## Description

I constructed this application with the intent to discover the uses of Progressive Web Applications (PWA). One of the benefits of these types of applications is that they are downloadable and function offline. That way, if the user loses internet connection, they will still be able to access their information. Even if they have not downloaded the application, they will still be able to access the application because of data stored in the browser.
